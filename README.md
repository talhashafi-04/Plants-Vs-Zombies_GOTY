# Plants-Vs-Zombies_GOTY

Redesigned the famous Plants Vs Zombies Game using SFML Library in C++

ZombieWarFrame Storyline:

In the peaceful world of Verdantia, a terrible invasion occurred. Extraterrestrial zombies attacked,
threatening all life. The inhabitants panicked, but the sentient plants of Verdantia fought back. They
used their natural powers to defend their home. In a desperate move, the Elderwood, the oldest
of them all, unleashed a powerful wave that banished the zombies and saved Verdantia. Though
wounded, the planet survived, thanks to its brave plant guardians.

Zombie Warframe Gameplay:

"Zombie WarFrame" is a popular tower defense video game where players defend their suburban
home from invading zombies. The game features a gridded lawn, with the player's house situated
on the left side. Players strategically place various types of plants on individual squares of the grid,
each offering unique defensive abilities such as shooting projectiles, exploding, or blocking
zombies. Different types of zombies exhibit distinct behaviors and vulnerabilities to specific plants;
for instance, the Balloon Zombie can float over plants but can be popped by the Cactus.
Throughout the game, players must collect sunlight, the in-game currency, either by clicking on
sun icons or using sun-generating plants like Sunflowers. Sun is used to purchase and place plants,
with each plant requiring a specific amount of sunlight. Players can also use a shovel to remove
plants if needed. Each lane features a single-use lawnmower, pool cleaner, and roof cleaner
positioned at the left end, which activates to eliminate zombies if they reach that point. However,
if a zombie reaches the end of a lane without an available cleaner, the player loses the level and
must restart or exit.

In "Zombie Warframe," players strategically defend their home from invading zombies by planting
various defensive plants. At the start of each level, players select plants from their inventory using
seed packets. These plants possess unique abilities, such as attacking zombies, generating sunlight
(the in-game currency), or providing defensive barriers. Sunlight is crucial for planting, collected
by clicking on sun icons that randomly appear on the lawn or using sun-producing plants like

Sunflowers. Players place their chosen plants on the gridded lawn, strategically positioning them
to counter waves of incoming zombies, each with different abilities and vulnerabilities. The game's
controls primarily involve mouse interaction, with players using the mouse to navigate menus,
select plants, and place them on the grid. Clicking is used to collect sunlight, select plants, and
interact with in-game elements like zombies and special abilities. Keyboard shortcuts may also be
available for certain actions, such as pausing the game or accessing menus. Overall, "Plants vs.
Zombies" offers accessible mechanics and controls, making it enjoyable for players of all skill levels.
