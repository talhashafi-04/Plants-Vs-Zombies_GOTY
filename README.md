**"Plants-Vs-Zombies"** is a popular tower defense video game where players defend their suburban home from invading zombies. The game features a gridded lawn, with the player's house situated on the left side. Players strategically place various types of plants on individual squares of the grid, each offering unique defensive abilities such as shooting projectiles, exploding, or blocking zombies. Different types of zombies exhibit distinct behaviors and vulnerabilities to specific plants; for instance, the Balloon Zombie can float over plants but can be popped by the Cactus.

### **Game Mechanics**

In **"Plants-Vs-Zombies"**, players strategically defend their home from invading zombies by planting various defensive plants. At the start of each level, players select plants from their inventory using seed packets. These plants possess unique abilities, such as attacking zombies, generating sunlight (the in-game currency), or providing defensive barriers. 

- **Sunlight**: Crucial for planting, collected by clicking on sun icons that randomly appear on the lawn or using sun-producing plants like Sunflowers.
- **Placement**: Players place their chosen plants on the gridded lawn, strategically positioning them to counter waves of incoming zombies, each with different abilities and vulnerabilities.

### **Controls**

The game's controls primarily involve mouse interaction:
- **Mouse**: Navigate menus, select plants, and place them on the grid. Click to collect sunlight, select plants, and interact with in-game elements like zombies and special abilities.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Available for certain actions, such as pausing the game or accessing menus.

Overall, **"Plants vs. Zombies"** offers accessible mechanics and controls, making it enjoyable for players of all skill levels.
